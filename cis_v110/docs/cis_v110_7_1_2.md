## Description

Ensure that all insecure (HTTP) client requests to applications and services hosted on IBM
Cloud Kubernetes Service are redirected to secure TLS connections (HTTPS), and ensure
that only TLS versions 1.2+ are supported.
You set up your Ingress ALB to secure your domain with the IBM-provided TLS certificate
or your custom TLS certificate. Some users might try to access your apps by using an
insecure http request to your ALB domain, for example http://www.myingress.com,
instead of using https. You can use the redirect annotation to always convert insecure
HTTP requests to HTTPS.

## Remediation

1. Edit the configuration file for the **ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm** configmap
resource by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
```

2. In the data section, remove the **ssl-protocols** key, or remove TLSv1 and TLSv1.1
from the value.

3. Edit the configuration for your Ingress resource by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl edit ingress <my_ingress> -n <my_namespace>
```

4. In the **annotations** section, add **ingress.bluemix.net/redirect-to-https:"True".**
