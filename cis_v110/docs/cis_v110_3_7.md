## Description

Check whether Activity Tracker trails are integrated with LogDNA Logs.

## Remediation

Managing Activity Tracker trails with LogDNA logs are multistep processes.

1. Log in to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com)
2. Go to the Menu icon. Then, select Observability to access the **Observability** dashboard.
3. Select Activity Tracker from the page navigation menu to see the auditing instances. Select Logging from the page navigation menu to see the logging
instances.
4. Check that you can see an *Activity Tracker instance in Frankfurt* and one instance for each location where you operate in the IBM Cloud.
5. To launch the **LogDNA** web UI, for each instance, select View **LogDNA**.
6. In the LogDNA web UI, verify that you can see audit events.
7. Identify the LogDNA instance ID in the LogDNA URL. This ID is used as part of the name of the archive file.

Further

1. If the option to configure archiving is not allowed, [upgrade the instanceâ€™s service plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-upgrade).
2. If archiving is not enabled for an instance, [review and define the archiving strategy](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-archiving).Then, configure archiving for an audit instance.
3. If you cannot find an instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) in your account, [provision on](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-provision).
