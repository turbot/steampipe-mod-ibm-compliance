## Description

IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket firewall restricts all access to data unless the request
originates from a list of allowed IP addresses.

## Remediation

### From Console

Follow the steps outlined to add an IP to the list of Authorized IPs in bucket firewall
policies

1. Start by selecting Storage to view your resource list.
2. Next, select the service instance with your bucket from within the Storage menu. This takes you to the Object **Storage** Console.
3. Select the bucket that you want to limit access to authorized IP addresses.
4. Select Access policies from the navigation menu.
5. Select the **Authorized IPs** tab.
6. Click on **Add** and specify a list of IP addresses in CIDR notation, for example 192.168.0.0/16, fe80:021b::0/64. Addresses can follow either IPv4 or IPv6 standards.
7. Click **Add**.
8. The firewall will not be enforced until the address is saved in the console. Click **Save all** to enforce the firewall.

**Note** that all objects in this bucket are only accessible from those IP addresses.
