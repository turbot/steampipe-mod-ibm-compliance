## Description

Image pull secrets are credentials that authorize your cluster to pull images from a private
image registry. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service integrates with IBM Cloud Container
Registry and provides pull secrets for IBM Cloud Container Registry in the default
Kubernetes namespace.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Log in to the IBM Cloud console at https://cloud.ibm.com/.
2. To view a list of your resources, go to **Menu > Resource** List.
3. From your IBM Cloud resource list, select your cluster.
4. From the **Overview** tab, for **Image pull secrets**, click **Enable**.
5. In the modal, click **Enable** to confirm.

### From Command Line:

1. Run the following command to create a service ID for the cluster and assign the
service ID an IAM Reader service role for IBM Cloud Container Registry. The
command also creates an API key to impersonate the service ID credentials and
stores the API key in a Kubernetes image pull secret in the default namespace of the
cluster.

```bash
ibmcloud ks cluster pull-secret apply --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
```
