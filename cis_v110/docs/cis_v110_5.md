## Description

Cloudant is a database, run as a service in the IBM Cloud. Its job is to store your application's data securely and allow you to retrieve it quickly and efficiently. The foundation of the IBM Cloudant managed database service is the Apache CouchDB database. IBM is active in the Apache CouchDB committee, employs members of the PMC, and commits most of its feature, functions, and enhancements back to the open source project. Over the last few years, IBM made significant effort to align the core feature set of IBM Cloudant and CouchDB. We contributed key features like IBM Cloudant Query/Mango query language, full-text search, and partition queries to CouchDB.

Apache CouchDB and IBM Cloudant are nearly fully API compatible, which means they can serve as drop-in replacements for each other in your application. They speak the same replication protocol so that you can seamlessly synchronize data between IBM Cloudant and CouchDB instances. However, some differences between the fully managed cloud service IBM Cloudant and self-managed open source Apache CouchDB still exist.
