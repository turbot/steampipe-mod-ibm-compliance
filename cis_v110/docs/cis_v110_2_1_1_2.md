## Description

You can use IBM Cloud encryption key management service, for example Key Protect, to
bring your own root key (BYOK) to IBM Cloud and use it to add envelope encryption for
data that is stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets.

## Remediation

### From Console

You will not be able to add Key Protect as the key management service once data is already
written to a Cloud Object Storage bucket. In order to ensure that objects are encrypted
using Key Protect root keys you will need to create a new Cloud Object Storage bucket, set
it to use Key Protect key management service and then upload/copy the existing objects to
this new bucket.
