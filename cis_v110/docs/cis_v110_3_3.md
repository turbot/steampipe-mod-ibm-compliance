## Description

Events that you collect and centralize in the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA
service provide information about actions that take place on your account. You can analyze
this data to resolve problems, identify anomalies, and be notified of abnormal situations.

## Remediation

You can define your own views, alerts, and notification channels. Default notification channels are configured by using presets.
