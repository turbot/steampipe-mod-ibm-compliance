## Description

VPC access control lists filter all incoming and outgoing traffic in IBM Cloud VPC. An ACL is a built-in, virtual firewall where ACL rules control traffic to and from the subnets, rather than to and from the virtual servers. It is recommended that no ACL allows unrestricted ingress access to port 22.
