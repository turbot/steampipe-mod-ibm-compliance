## Overview

IAM enables you to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to
resources consistently across IBM Cloud. A set of IBM Cloud services is enabled to use IBM
Cloud IAM for access control, and are organized into resource groups within your account
so you can give users access quickly to more than one resource at a time. Each of these
services is labeled as "IAM-enabled" in the catalog. You can use IAM access policies to
assign users and service IDs access to resources within your account. And, you can group
users and service IDs into an access group to easily give all members of the group the same
level of access.
