## Description

IBMÂ® Key Protect for IBM Cloud is a regional key management service with automatic features that help keep your applications secure and operational.

Key Protect can be configured to provide high availability capabilities, such as IBM-owned
infrastructure in multizone regions, to meet local access and low latency requirements for
each supported region. Additionally, it can be configured to continuously back up keys in
the region that the service operates in, and automatically recover and restart service
components after any disaster event. You are responsible to plan for availability
configuration on the different regions, and copying keys into a backup instance of Key
Protect on a periodic basis.
