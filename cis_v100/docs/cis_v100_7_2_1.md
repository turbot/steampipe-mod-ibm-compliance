## Description

Vulnerability Advisor provides security management for IBM Cloud Container Registry,
generating a security status report that includes suggested fixes and best practices. Images
for which Vulnerability Advisor reports vulnerabilities should not be deployed to
Kubernetes clusters. Container Image Security Enforcement (CISE) retrieves information
from Vulnerability Advisor to block deployments of vulnerable images.

## Remediation

1. Set the cluster as the context for this session.

```bash
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
```

2. [Set up Helm in your cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#helm).
3. Add the IBM chart repository to your Helm client.

```bash
helm repo add iks-charts https://icr.io/helm/iks-charts
```

4. Install the Container Image Security Enforcement Helm chart into your cluster.

For Helm 2:

```bash
helm install --name cise iks-charts/ibmcloud-image-enforcement
```

For Helm 3:

```bash
helm install cise iks-charts/ibmcloud-image-enforcement
```

5. Container Image Security Enforcement is now installed, and applies the default
security policy for all Kubernetes namespaces in your cluster. For information about
customizing the security policy for Kubernetes namespaces in your cluster, or the
cluster overall, see [Customizing policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-security_enforce_portieris#customize_policies).
