## Description

You can use IBM Cloud encryption key management services, for example, Hyper Protect
Crypto Services to keep and manage exclusive control over the root keys used to add
envelop encryption for data that is stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets.

## Remediation


You will not be able to add Hyper Protect Crypto Services as the key management service
once data is already written to a Cloud Object Storage bucket. In order to ensure that
objects are encrypted using Hyper Protect Crypto Services root keys you will need to create
a new Cloud Object Storage bucket, set it to use Hyper Protect Crypto Services key
management service and then upload/copy the existing objects to this new bucket.
