## Description

A strong password is a very important step towards account security and safety. Passwords
should never be shared with anyone, and must follow the strong password requirements as
follows -
- Password must contain at least one uppercase letter
- Password must contain at least one lowercase letter
- Password must contain at least one number
- Password must contain at least 8 characters
- Passwords should not be reused
- Password must only contain ASCII characters
- Password cannot contain spaces, or any of these characters - ** `;:{"?)<> **
- Ensure the usage of a password meter which coaches user to create a stronger password than the minimum

## Remediation

IBM Cloud automatically prevents the usage of any passwords that do not meet password requirements, when the users are created in IBMid system. When enterprises integrate through enterprise federation (using SAML), then enterprise identity system is responsible for enforcing password strength.
