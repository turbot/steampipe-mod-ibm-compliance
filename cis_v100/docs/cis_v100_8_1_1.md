## Description

In Key Protect, you can set a rotation policy for a key or manually rotate the key.

IBM Cloud Key Management Service (KMS): Key Protect (KP) allows customers to rotate the Data Encryption Key (DEK) which is key material stored within the KMS Hardware Security Module (HSM), which is tied to the key ID of the Customer Created customer master key (CMK). It is the DEK that is used to perform cryptographic operations such as encryption and decryption. When it's time to rotate the key based on the rotation interval
that you specify, Key Protect automatically replaces the root key with new key material.

Automated key rotation currently retains all prior DEK keys so that decryption of encrypted data can take place transparently.
