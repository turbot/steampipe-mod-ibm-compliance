## Description

With IBM CloudTM Security Advisor, you can instantly view the security posture of your IBM
Cloud services through a single, centralized dashboard.
The service receives security information from various sources and displays any security
alerts or vulnerabilities that require your attention in the service dashboard. Out of the box,
there are several pre-populated cards in your dashboard. These findings are from security
services in IBM Cloud, but you can also add cards or custom partner solutions so that all of
your security tools can be accessed from the same location.

Through pre-integrated findings, you can monitor:

1. Certificates that you manage with IBM Cloud Certificate Manager
2. Vulnerabilities in container images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry

## Remediation

All remediation steps must be applied to the vulnerability in the container image by image
owners.
