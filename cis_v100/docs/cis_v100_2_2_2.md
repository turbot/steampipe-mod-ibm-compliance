## Description

By default, IBM Cloud Block Storage provides provider-managed encryption for all data.
For enhanced security, customers can bring their own encryption keys and manage them
through IBM Key Management Services – Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Services
(HPCS). Provider-managed encryption is turned on by default and cannot be turned off.

## Remediation

You will not be able to change encryption option once data is already written to a Cloud
Block Storage Volume. In order to ensure that objects are encrypted using customer
managed keys you will need to create a new Cloud Block Storage volume, set it to use either
Key Protect or Hyper Protect key management service and then upload/copy the existing
objects to this new volume.
