## Description

Events that you collect and centralize in the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA
service provide information about actions that take place on your account. You can define
alerts to notify promptly of problems, anomalies, and abnormal situations.

## Remediation

IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA does not include default templates for views or alerts.
You can define your own views, alerts, and notification channels. Default notification channels are configured by using presets.
