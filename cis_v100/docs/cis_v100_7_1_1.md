## Description

Protect sensitive information in your IBM CloudTM Kubernetes Service cluster to ensure
data integrity and to prevent your data from being exposed to unauthorized users.

**Understanding Key Management Service (KMS) providers**

You can protect the etcd component in your Kubernetes master and Kubernetes secrets by
using a Kubernetes key management service (KMS) provider that encrypts secrets with
encryption keys that you control.

**Supported KMS providers**

IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service supports the following KMS providers:
1. IBMÂ® Key Protect for IBM CloudTM for public cloud or on-prem environments.
2. Hyper Protect Crypto Services for keep your own key (KYOK) crypto unit support.

Because adding a different KMS provider requires updating the managed master default
configuration, you cannot add other KMS providers to the cluster.
