## Description

Use IAM settings to restrict user API key creation and service ID (and related API key) creation in the account. Enable both settings to restrict all users in the account from creating user API keys and service IDs except those with an IAM policy that explicitly allows it.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Log in to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com).
2. Click **Manage -> Access (IAM)**.
3. Click **Settings**.
4. In the Account section of the Settings page, ensure that **Restrict API key creation** and **Restrict service ID creation** are enabled.
5. Once enabled, only users with the correct IAM policies will be able to create user API keys and service IDs.
