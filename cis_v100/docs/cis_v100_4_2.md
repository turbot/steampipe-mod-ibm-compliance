## Description

The IBM Cloud Databases services can only be connected to over TLS or HTTPS
connections. This behavior is by default and is non-configurable. Customers are provided
self-signed certificates and most appropriately configure driver or application to utilize
these certificates and encryption in motion.

## Remediation

There is no remediation procedure available on database side. If client side is having issues
connecting to the database, the client must ensure that they are using TLS 1.2> or HTTPS
from application or client library.
