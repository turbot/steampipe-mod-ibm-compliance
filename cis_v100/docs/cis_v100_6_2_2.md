## Description

VPC security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to Virtual Server. It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access to a Virtual Server. Unless modified, the default security group allows inbound traffic from all members of the group that is, all other virtual servers that are attached to this security group.

## Remediation

3. For the default security group, perform the following:
    - Identify the Inbound rule.
    - Update the rule to only allow the required traffic flow.
