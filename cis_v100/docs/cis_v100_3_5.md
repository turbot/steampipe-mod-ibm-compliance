## Description

Monitor the account owner's access to the IBM Cloud account is done from authorized
locations that are restricted by IP addresses.

## Remediation

Complete the following steps to monitor the locations from which the account owner logs
in to the account:

First, you need to identify the email of the account owner.

1. In the Cloud UI, go to **Manage > Access (IAM)**, then select Users.
2. Identify the user that has the tag owner.
3. Select the account owner. Then, click **Details**.
4. Copy the email address of the account owner and the list of authorized IP addresses.

Launch the Activity Tracker instance in Frankfurt. This is the instance where login security events are collected in the account. In the Views section, select the Everything view. Then, enter the following query in the search bar: (action login) AND initiator.name: **< email address >** AND -initiator.host.address:(list of IP addresses). Replace with the account owner's email address. Replace with the list of IP addresses that are separated by
OR, for example, (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx OR xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) and configured for the account owner. The view now reports all the events that are reported when the account owner tries to login from an unauthorized location.

Next, you can define an alert on the view to get a notification immediately after 1 event is received.
