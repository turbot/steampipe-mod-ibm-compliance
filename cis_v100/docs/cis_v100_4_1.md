## Description

IBM Cloud Databases provides automatic encryption at rest when provisioning the service.
It is not an option to deploy a database service without encryption at rest. However, using
the service's integration with IBM Key Protect, customers are able to bring their own
encryption key at provision time for the database.

## Remediation

There is no zero-downtime remediation procedure . Customer must restore a backup with
a new encryption key or create a net new database instance with Bring Your Own Key
enabled.
